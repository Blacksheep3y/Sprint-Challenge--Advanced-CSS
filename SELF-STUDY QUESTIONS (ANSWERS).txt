1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
    A: With An adaptive website widths are still hardcoded at each media query, 
    and with a Responsive site responsive units are used throughout the site.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    A: Designing for mobile first means designing the html/css intended
    for a mobile width size and utilizing mediaqueries with a min-width.
    Designing for desktop first means designing the html/css intended for
    a desktop width size and then utilizing mediaqueries with a max-width.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
    A: It allows our rem units to scale proportionally for example
    with an html width of 62.5% and a font-size of 25px. The sizing properties 
    would be as follows 2.5rem, 2.5em, 250%, etc.
4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    A: preprocessing is basically the use of a software technology to minimize the 
    original css into a more robust syntax then later "preprocess" this new css into the index.css file. It
    allows for multiple files of preprocessing to all converge into one final css file.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
    A: I have to say that I love the use of Parametric mixins because it allows for such dynamic use of 
    css styles. I would say my least favorite part would be how complicated variables can get and sort of 
    how interwoven they can be with variables inside variables inside mixins etc. At the same time, I find that
    versatility really cool too, but things can get confusing if you are not careful.
